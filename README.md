<h3>📘 GFG 160 – Complete DSA Practice Journey</h3>

This repository contains my systematic solutions to the GeeksforGeeks 160 DSA Problem Set.
The goal of this repository is not just problem solving, but to build strong DSA fundamentals, improve problem-solving patterns, and maintain consistency with clean, readable code.

<h3>🎯 Objective</h3>

Solve all 160 problems from the GFG curated DSA list

Cover all core DSA topics step by step

Write optimized and readable solutions

Track progress publicly for discipline & accountability

Build a strong DSA foundation for interviews and competitive programming

Progress is updated continuously as I solve problems.



<h3>🧩 Problem-Solving Approach</h3>

For every problem, I focus on:

Understanding constraints

Identifying the pattern (two pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.)

Writing brute force first (mentally), then optimizing

Ensuring time & space complexity are optimal

Keeping solutions simple, not clever


<h3>💡 Example Problem Breakdown</h3>

Each solution typically includes:

Clear logic

Edge case handling

Optimal complexity

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(1)


<h3>🚀 Why This Repository Matters</h3>

Shows consistency, not random practice

Covers interview-relevant DSA

Demonstrates growth over time

Acts as my personal DSA notebook

Useful for revision before interviews


<h3>🛠️ Tech Stack</h3>

Language: Java (as per problem requirement)

Platform: GeeksforGeeks

IDE: VS Code


📌 How to Use This Repo

<h3>📅 Commitment</h3>

I am committed to:

Completing all 160 problems

Updating the repository regularly

Maintaining clean and understandable code


<h3>⭐ Final Note (Important)</h3>

This repository is not for shortcuts.
It reflects daily discipline, mistakes, learning, and improvement.
